FIELDS: 
    A resource object’s attributes and its relationships are collectively called its “fields”.
    Fields for a resource object MUST share a common namespace with each other and with type and id. In other words, a resource can not have an attribute and relationship with the same name, nor can it have an attribute or relationship named type or id.
